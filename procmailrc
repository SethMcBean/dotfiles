# For security, only allow procmail to know certain things and drop any
# non-user privileges that procmail may have had.

# Explicitly define helper app paths as env variables this saves us typing a
# lot, and also keeps a massive path away from procmail should anything go
# awry. If gmsgp isn't installed, you can use the standard xmessage utility,
# but it's not as sexy.  Sexy is important.

###### RECIPES ######
#Whatever recipes you'll use
#The order of the recipes is significant


# DUPLICATE REMOVAL
# This rule uses formail to remove emails that have a message-id that has
# already passed through the system. It keeps an 8K log.  "W" waits until it
# gets the exit code from formail and filters if appropriate. the 'h' means
# pipe the headers only. it uses a user-defined lockfile for this task.

#### Filter mail with bogofilter

# if it's already got a spam: yes header from my upstream, then bye bye

BOGOFILTER_DIR=$HOME/.bogofilter

# bogofilter passthrough-update
# -u for update wordlists (autolearn based on classification)
# -e for embedded operation
# -p for pass-through
# -l for logging
# -v be verbose

## error catcher ##
#     If bogofilter failed, return the mail to the queue.
#     Better put this after _EACH_ delivering recipe (not shown here).
#     Later, the MTA will try again to deliver it.
#     75 is the value for EX_TEMPFAIL in /usr/include/sysexits.h

#### Now that we got rid of spam, let's clean up mail cruft

# Add a Content-Length to mails that don't have them
:0 hfw
* !^Content-Length:
| formail -a "Content-Length: 0000000000"

# MAILDIR LINES
# Add Lines header for mutt with Maildirs. Mutt shows lines based on Lines
# header.  We have to do this manually for Maildir delivered messages.

* H ?? !^Lines:
* -1^0
*  1^1 ^.*$
| formail -A "Lines: $="

# SIGNATURE DELIMITER FIXER
# Some people haven't realised that '--' is actually an incorrect sig
# delimiter, so this quickly sed-fixes it for them. I contemplated
# automatically sending a "FIX YER DELIMITER!" email, but that would just be an
# unproductive nuisance.
